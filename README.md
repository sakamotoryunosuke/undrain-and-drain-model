undrain and drain model is a code that simulates tidal modulation of tremor (phase difference, tidal sensitivity).
numericalcalculation is a code that solves drain/undrain model numerically.
Our two models are one-degree-of-freedom spring-slider model and governed by rate-and-state friction law using slip law.
In addition, we intorduce dilatancy/compaciton in shear zone to our models.
we assume that Our two models follow quasi-static equation of motion.
approximateexpression is the code for the approximate solution for the response of the block to tidal stress
